# To-Do-List
This project is a simple and functional To-Do List Web Application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript without any external frameworks or libraries. It allows users to add new tasks, mark them as complete, and delete them â€” all with real-time updates in the browser, without needing a page refresh. The app interface includes an input box, an "Add" button, and a dynamic task list. JavaScript handles DOM manipulation, event listening, and state updates, while CSS is used to style the layout clearly and responsively. This project strengthens core front-end skills, including working with the Document Object Model (DOM), using event listeners, and managing application state in a clean, interactive way. It's an ideal beginner-friendly project that demonstrates essential web development concepts and can be further expanded with features like localStorage, filters, or drag-and-drop in future iterations.
